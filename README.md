# Parallel Rust Dettrace

This is the beginning of a dettrace implementation in Rust. See branch emptyPtracer
for a bare bones implementation of a ptracer.

## Installation
Given a proper cargo set up. `cargo build` works using rustc 1.28. It should work for
any newer version though.

## Usage
Currently simple programs works:

```
cargo run pwd
```
