# ProcessCache

This is the implementation of ProcessCache: a system that provides automatic caching of computation at the process level.

## Installation
Given a proper cargo set up. `cargo build` works using rustc 1.28. It should work for
any newer version though.

## Usage
Currently simple programs work:

```
cargo run pwd
```
