# IOTracker

This is the implementation of IOTracker: a system that tracks the inputs and outputs of programs at the exec level.

## Installation
Given a proper cargo set up. `cargo build` works using rustc 1.47.0. It should work for any newer version though.

## Usage
Currently simple programs work:

```
cargo run pwd
```
